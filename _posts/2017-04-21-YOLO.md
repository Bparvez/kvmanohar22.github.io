title: Weight Initialization 
--- 
Initializing weights randomly is one of <b>the</b> most important tasks in training a deep neural network.
You can find [here](https://github.com/kvmanohar22/DeepNets) how weights affect the internal working of a neural network.
I'll update this post with some more interesting things related to weight initialization.
<br> That's it for now! Until next time!!
