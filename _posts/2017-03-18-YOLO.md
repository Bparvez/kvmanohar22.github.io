<b>YOLO</b> (You Only Look Once) is an Unified Real-Time Object Detection algorithm.
<br>
You can find the original paper on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640). 
<br>
I plan on implementing this paper in python using [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) deep learning framework.
<br>
You can find the progress of this project code [here](https://www.github.com/kvmanohar22/YOLO-tf). I'll update this blog as and when I make substantial progress.
<br>
That's it for now! Until next time!!
