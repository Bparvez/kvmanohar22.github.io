Hey there !! <br>
I'm applying for Google Summer of Code 2017 under [OpenCV](https://www.opencv.org) where
I plan to work on the task of object detection by developing highly compact models. You can find my proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zUxaQ4WYM211WaS17Dbe1jHlNeN7Twt0Aws5tt1zKXU/edit?usp=sharing).
In this blog I will track the progress of my GSoC project if I get selected !
