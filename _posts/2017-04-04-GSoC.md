Hey there !! <br><br>
I'm applying for Google Summer of Code 2017 under [OpenCV](https://www.opencv.org) where
I plan to work on the task of object detection by developing highly compact models. You can find my proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zUxaQ4WYM211WaS17Dbe1jHlNeN7Twt0Aws5tt1zKXU/edit?usp=sharing). I will blog the progress of my GSoC project here!<br>
Yayy! Got selected to Google Summer of Code 2017. Looking forward to a great 
summer !

## Community Bonding Period
As outlined in my proposal I'll be working on the task of Object Detection which
involves generating bounding boxes for the detected objects in an image. I've 
divided my entire timeline into three major phases which includes: <br>
- Training a Deep Learning Model on ImageNet dataset for Image Classification
- Adding additional layers to the above trained model and retraining on PASCAL
  dataset
- Implement Deep Compression methods to reduce the size of the model 

During this period I spent my time in setting up my developement environment on the server by installing [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) Deep Learning framework, downloading the humongous [ILSVRC-2012 dataset](http://image-net.org/), reading up the research papers outlined in my proposal. 
Caffe is a great framework but what it lacks is documentation and tutorials for a beginner :(. Constrained to implement my project in C++,  I had to go through the [official API](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/doxygen/annotated.html) and figure out myself what's happening under the hood. 
Luckily I had a bit of experience working on Google Protocol Buffers which is largely used in Caffe for defining various core classes. 
And since I had some time to kill during this period, I thought "Hey, why not create few tutorials ?" and so began the saga of writing few tutorials aimed to kick start the understanding of Caffe framework which I'll be releasing pretty soon once I complete them. This pretty much sums up my Community Bonding Period.

## Phase 1 of GSoC : Training SqueezeNet Model on ImageNet
Coming soon...
